#' Cortisol levels for different birth types
#'
#' Cortisol levels were measured for different types of birth. The accompanying data on cortisol level was reported in the
#' article “Cortisol, Cortisone, and 11-Deoxycortisol Levels in
#' Human Umbilical and Maternal Plasma in Relation to the
#' Onset of Labor” (J. Obstetric Gynaecology British Com-
#'                    monwealth, 1974: 737–745). Experimental subjects were
#' pregnant women whose babies were delivered between 38
#' and 42 weeks gestation. Group 1 individuals elected to
#' deliver by Caesarean section before labor onset, group 2
#' delivered by emergency Caesarean during induced labor,
#' and group 3 individuals experienced spontaneous labor.
